## Notes
- Priority reflects impact × likelihood as currently understood. Revisit after initial spikes/POCs.
- Owners are accountable for planning and completing validation within their area.
- Where Unknown is marked, add a short spike and convert to either an accepted Assumption (with evidence) or a risk.
