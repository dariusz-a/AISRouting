| Issue | Evidence | Proposed Fix | Impact if unfixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backend API latency p95 mismatch (250 ms vs 300 ms) | `ADR_001.md § Context` (“role CRUD ≤ 250 ms p95”), `ADR_001.md § Consequences` (CRUD ≤ 250 ms p95), `design_doc_v1_0.md § 6.3 Latency & Availability` (Backend API p95 ≤ 250 ms), vs `c4_deployment.md § 3) SLOs & Capacity Assumptions` (“Backend API: ≤ 300 ms”) | c4_deployment § SLOs & Capacity: change “Backend API: ≤ 300 ms” → “Backend API: p95 ≤ 250 ms” | Conflicting SLO drives wrong alerts/autoscaling and obscures regressions |
| Shell FCP target mismatch (1.5 s vs 1.8 s) | `ADR_001.md § Context` (FCP ≤ 1.5 s p95), `c4_context.md § Notes (QAs)` (FCP ≤ 1.5 s p95) vs `design_doc_v1_0.md § 6.3 Latency & Availability` (FCP p95 ≤ 1.8 s) | ADR Context: change “FCP ≤ 1.5 s p95” → “FCP ≤ 1.8 s p95”; c4_context Notes: change “FCP ≤ 1.5s p95” → “FCP ≤ 1.8 s p95” | Divergent targets cause false SLO violations or lax acceptance in reviews |
| Metric wording error (“error rate < 1% p95”) | `ADR_001.md § Consequences` lists “error rate < 1% p95” | ADR Consequences: change “error rate < 1% p95” → “error rate < 1%” | Misleading metric label may skew monitoring/alerts and audits |
| Alternative naming misaligned with matrix (Alt‑B vs Candidate C) | `ADR_001.md § Alternatives` labels offline‑first as “Alt‑B”, while `alt_arch_matrix.md` names it “Candidate C — Event‑driven Offline‑first” | ADR Alternatives: change header “Alt‑B” → “Candidate C — Event‑driven Offline‑first Client with Sync” | Confuses decision traceability and undermines ADR→matrix linkage |
| Risk table link points to OCR instead of risks doc | `ADR_001.md § Links & Evidence` shows “Risk table docs/tech_design/architecture/ocr.md (Risks & Assumptions)” while risks are in `risks_mitigation.md` | ADR Links & Evidence: replace “Risk table docs/tech_design/architecture/ocr.md” → “docs/tech_design/architecture/risks_mitigation.md” | Breaks evidence chain for risk sign‑off and auditability |
| C4/Deployment diagrams marked TBD though docs exist | `ADR_001.md § Links & Evidence` lists “Diagrams (C4/Deployment) TBD”; repository has `c4_context.md`, `c4_container.md`, `c4_deployment.md` | ADR Links & Evidence: change “TBD” → “c4_context.md, c4_container.md, c4_deployment.md” | Reviewers miss architecture views; weakens ADR credibility |
| SLO source pointer not aligned to DesignDoc | `ADR_001.md § Links & Evidence` says “SLO draft: This ADR (Consequences) and selected_winner.md QA posture” vs SLOs defined in `design_doc_v1_0.md § 6` | ADR Links & Evidence: change “SLO draft: This ADR … and selected_winner.md QA posture” → “SLOs: See design_doc_v1_0.md § 6 SLOs & Capacity Assumptions” | SLO ownership unclear; risks inconsistent enforcement |
| Ingress boundary not explicit in Container view | `c4_container.md § Backend API Key interfaces` says “Ingress: HTTP REST/JSON (GraphQL optional)”; `c4_deployment.md` uses API Gateway/Ingress | c4_container (Backend API Key interfaces): change “Ingress: HTTP REST/JSON (GraphQL optional)” → “Ingress: HTTP REST/JSON via API Gateway/Ingress (GraphQL optional)” | Ambiguous network boundary complicates security and ops reviews |
| Route‑change SLO missing from Deployment SLOs | `design_doc_v1_0.md § 6.3` includes “Capability MFEs (route change) p95 ≤ 250 ms”; `ADR_001.md § Context/Consequences` cite same; `c4_deployment.md § 3)` omits it | c4_deployment § SLOs & Capacity: add one line “Capability MFEs (route change): p95 ≤ 250 ms” | Partial SLO coverage; may regress SPA UX without alerts |
| Missing compliance SLO in summary table | `risks_mitigation.md` (GDPR residency breach) and `c4_deployment.md` (EU region) define posture, but `design_doc_v1_0.md § 6.9 Summary Table` has no compliance row | design_doc_v1_0.md § 6.9: add row “Compliance | residency_violations = 0; data_transfer_out_of_region_bytes = 0 | SLO dashboard | Zero cross‑region data movement” | Compliance risk not tracked at a glance; weakens audit readiness |
