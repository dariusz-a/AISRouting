# QA Session for User Manual

This file will record each question and answer pair during the interactive session to build the user manual.

---

## Question 1

**Q:** What is the application's name (replace <APP>) and a one-sentence description of its primary purpose?

**A:** name is AisToXmlRouteConvertor

## Question 6

**Q:** Ship selection control shall look like a table. Columns: MMSI; size of the corresponding folder in MB (sum of sizes of all files in it); interva [min date, max date]; ship lenght (if available); ship width(if available). Selection: whole row. The selected row defines the ShipStaticData which is to be shown on the "ship data" panel.

**A:** Ship selection control shall look like a table with columns as specified. Selecting a row sets the active ship and populates the ShipStaticData panel with details and min/max dates.

## Question 7

**Q:** For the `ShipStaticData` panel (displayed after selecting a ship), list the fields to show, their formats, which are editable (if any), and whether any values can be copied/exported. Also specify how min/max available dates should be displayed and whether time selection uses seconds-resolution input or date/time pickers.

**A:** ShipStaticData panel shall display all the data from the `ShipStaticData` record with no exclusion. Time picker panel is outside ShipStaticData panel and is a separate UI element.

## Question 8

**Q:** For the Time Picker control (separate from ShipStaticData), do you want: seconds-resolution numeric inputs, date+time pickers, or both (date/time UI with seconds)? Also specify labels, default values (e.g., start = min, end = max), validation (start < end, inside available range), and whether to allow typing exact seconds.

**A:** Yes, date/time UI with seconds. Also labels default values: start = min, end = max

## Question 9

**Q:** For the `Create Track` button and processing action: what should the label be, should there be a progress indicator or cancel option during processing, expected success/failure messages, and what happens to the UI after processing completes (e.g., open output folder, show generated file list)?

**A:** Label: "Process!". This is the main button. Shall be big. No progress bar. Simple. After done, the message is shown in the blocking msgbox. File list? there is only one file. Which list are you talking about?

## Question 10

**Q:** For the track optimization step (deduplication based on significant deviation), what thresholds or rules should be used? For example: minimum distance change in meters, minimum heading change in degrees, ROT threshold, minimum time gap — provide numeric defaults or say "tunable by config" if you prefer to make them adjustable.

**A:** Filter. For **new** it checks 2 previous recodrs, **prev** and **prev-prev**. **new** record is always added. The filter if removes, it removes **prev** record. Conditions are as follows. Shall be applied in the order as follows.
 - dt between prev and prev-prev is less than threshold (adjustable as an edit field in "Thresholds" panel in edit box), the prev record is discarded.
	- use prev-prev record, new record, calculate by linear interpolation (time as an argument) the **interpolated-prev** record at the time of prev record time. If distance between positions of prev and interpolated-prev records is less than a threshold (distance tolerance field in Thresholds pannel), discard prev record.

## Question 11

**Q:** Any additional processing outputs besides the single XML file? For example: logs, debug files, or a small processing report (CSV/JSON) to help QA validate results? If yes, specify format and location. If no, we'll keep only the XML output.

**A:** Only xml.

## Question 12

**Q:** Do you want the application to validate the generated XML against a schema or the provided `route_waypoint_template.xml`? If yes, should validation errors be shown in the blocking message box and prevent file write? If no, the app will always write the XML produced.

**A:** Why there should be errors if it is generated by the deterministic algorithm that does it correctly and according to the provided example?




## Question 2

**Q:** Who are the primary users of AisToXmlRouteConvertor (e.g., mariners, route planners, system integrators, administrators)?

**A:** This is going to be internal tool used by QA engineers, no exposure to external customers. Simplicity of the code is the key

## Question 3

**Q:** How do QA engineers obtain and prepare AIS input data for the tool? Describe file formats, naming conventions, and any preprocessing steps needed.

**A:** Source of data does not matter ("by magic"). The setup is simple as described in `docs/idea/idea.md`: there is an `input` folder that contains all the input data organized as per the Source Data structure (one subfolder per MMSI, a `<MMSI>.json` with static ship data and multiple `<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv` files with AIS data). The `output` folder is where generated XML files will be saved. CSV schema follows the `ShipDataOut` structure described in `idea.md`.

## Question 4

**Q:** For the `Input folder` UI control, please provide the exact label text, control type, default value, validation rules, behaviors after selection (e.g., scan for MMSI subfolders, populate ship dropdown, show min/max dates), error messages or warnings, persistence (last-used path), tooltip/help text, and whether drag-and-drop is supported.

**A:** Label: "Select input folder". UI: standard windows folder selection dialogue (browser or whatever it is called). 

## Question 5

**Q:** For the `Output folder` UI control, please provide the exact label text, control type, default value, validation rules, behaviors after selection, error messages, persistence, tooltip/help text, and whether drag-and-drop is supported.

**A:** Label: "Select output folder". UI: standard windows folder selection dialogue (browser or whatever it is called).
